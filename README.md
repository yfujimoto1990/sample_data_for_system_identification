This .mat file includes input-output data obtained from Quanser QUBE Servo2. This file is uploaded as a sample data for system identification methods. 


u: input voltage (Chirp signal)
y: output angular velocity
uval: input voltage (pulse signal, validation data)
yval: output angular velocity (validation data)
Ts: sampling time
